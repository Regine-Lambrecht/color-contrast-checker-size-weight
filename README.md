Color Contrast Checker - Chrome Extension
A simple but powerful developer tool to check color contrast ratios against WCAG AA accessibility standards. This extension provides real-time feedback and suggests compliant color alternatives to help you build more accessible websites.

Features
WCAG AA Compliance: Instantly checks if your color combinations pass the WCAG AA standards.

Smart Text Detection: Automatically determines if your text is "Normal" or "Large" based on font size and weight, applying the correct contrast ratio (4.5:1 or 3:1).

Flexible Units: Input font sizes in either px or pt.

Live Color Picker: Use a native color picker or type in hex codes directly.

Improvement Suggestions: If your contrast fails, the tool provides two accessible color alternatives—one for each color—while preserving the original hue.

Clean & Modern UI: A polished and intuitive interface makes checking contrast quick and easy.

How to Install
Since this is not on the Chrome Web Store, you can load it as an "unpacked extension":

Download the Files: Make sure you have all the project files (manifest.json, popup.html, popup.js, this README.md, and the icons folder) in a single folder on your computer.

Open Chrome Extensions: Open Google Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions, or click the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar and select "Manage Extensions."

Enable Developer Mode: In the top-right corner of the extensions page, turn on the "Developer mode" toggle.

Load the Extension: Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears on the top-left.

Select the Folder: In the file dialog, select the folder where you saved all the project files and click "Select."

Done! The "Color Contrast Checker" will now appear in your list of extensions, and its icon will be available in your Chrome toolbar.

How to Use
Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup.

Enter your desired font size, font weight, and the two colors you want to test.

Click the "Check Contrast" button.

The results will be displayed instantly, showing the current ratio, the needed ratio, and a clear PASS/FAIL status.

If the contrast fails, a suggestions section will appear with compliant color alternatives.
